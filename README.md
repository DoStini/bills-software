# Billing Software
This project was made with java using javaFX framework.
It was used to help out a small institution in a summer fair, to calculate and print bills. 

## Instalation
I'll keep updated executables updated in master branch.

 1. Download executable folder
 2. Execute Printer chooser to setup the printer. Using a POS Printer is ideal, but works with any kind.
 3. Execute faturacao to initialize the software.
## Usage
 
 - If the program crashes, it autosaves the current day's earnings.
 - If the printer doesn't print anything, you can access your last bill to re-check or to print again.
 - When you end your day, press "End day" button to print out everything and save a file containing information about the ammout of sold items.
